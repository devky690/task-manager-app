//api//ran into trouble with find method from mongoose not being found. From past experiences programming in 
java, sometimes i put semicolons where they arent needed. I fixed the issue of mongoose method not
being found by removing the semicolon when exporting model

making the rest api through postman made the process much nicer 

body-parser gave me a bit of trouble but then i realized that while i would need to include the actual
param in my router and not in an external defined endpoint...I was trying to just focus on having 
1 id in router but that didnt work but i was able to fix it by including two ids into my router and
i was able to parse the request from the body which contained the objectId from the database
//api//

//client//
styling was challenging as well but materialize was useful for centering elements and making sure
everything was responsive between different screen sizes

I have never done development with angular but with react which im used to so it was quite challenging.
But I know from experience to think of everything as a component rather than seperate js and html code.
If I were able to work on it more, I would finish my task-item component and do editing on that resource


i made a webrequest service to define request uris/or resources i wanted

then i expanded on them on individual service components

i also wanted to implement routers to go to a specific category
and listing them
//client//
